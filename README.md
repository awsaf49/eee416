# Title: IoT based Smart Helmet for Industrial Workers

## Abstract
In this project, we aim to make a cheap but best effective Smart Helmet based on IoT which
will not only monitor the real-time working conditions of workers but also alert the control
center in case of accidents. The main features of the helmet include sensing workers' body
temperature, the temperature of surroundings, detection of harmful gases, fall detection, and position of the worker in the plant. The helmet can send the measured data to the cloud platform for
monitoring purposes and an alert buzzer is turned on in the industry for warning against any
harmful conditions, also it will send an alert via message to the supervising team. Arduino
Uno is used as the microcontroller for prototyping purposes and ThingSpeak is used as the
cloud computing platform.
